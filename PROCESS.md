#### Image Matching

- [x] RGB to HSV conversion using track bar
- [x] inRange + Canny to find edge
- [x] erode-dilate algorithm
- [x] find + draw contour
- [x] correct perspective
- [x] compare by XOR
- [x] show matching percentage
- [x] use camera on RasPi to detect
- [x] add contour area compare
- [x] RGB to HSV converter (click to get RGB/HSV event -> draw an area to get the HSV range)
